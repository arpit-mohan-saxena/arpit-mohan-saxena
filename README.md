Hey I am Arpit, so a while ago I was not much into tech but since I joined [SRMIST](https://www.srmist.edu.in/) I started feeling some sorta attachement towards technology so I started working around some languages and frameworks like C++, Java, Python, Javascript, Dart, ReactJS, React Native and more, in short I am just another guy who wanna explore this amazing world full of learing and new tech evolving every second.
I would like the explore this world full of surprises with AGI(Artificial Generative Intelligence) evolving with humans.
